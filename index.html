                Famed as Kakashi of the Sharingan (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi), 
                he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja; regularly looked to for advice
                and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his 
                students on Team 7, Kakashi teaches the importance of teamwork, a lesson
                he received, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha.

            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>
                Since his early childhood, Kakashi was very independent and self-confident, 
                at times even appearing arrogant and condescending. Despite that, Kakashi 
                was very perceptive and intuitive, quickly realising the situation for what 
                it was. After his father's death, Kakashi became more stern, aloof and cold 
                toward others, following all the rules to the letter, chastising any who disobeyed 
                them and being willing to abandon his comrades to finish missions.</p>
            <p>
                As an adult, Kakashi typically has a relaxed and almost bored attitude, not prone 
                to getting too worked up about anything or by anyone. Despite his increasingly 
                growing reputation and prowess as a ninja, Kakashi has shown no signs of arrogance, 
                and is rather modest about his abilities. He is habitually tardy, showing up when 
                it suits him, using excuses that convince nobody, and later leaving for equally poor 
                reasons. Though Kakashi wants others to believe this is how he always acts, he only 
                does so for matters that aren't of particular importance.
